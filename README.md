# DayTrader

## Overview

Day Trader is an app designed to give amateur investors greater visibility into, and control over their investment portfolio.
In addition the usual functionality available to investors through their brokerage websites, DayTrader is designed to allow the user to:
Visualize the make-up of their portfolio
- Compare stock performance ‘side-by-side’
- Analyze custom scenarios to help them make the right decisions about what to buy/sell next
- Log and update notes and decisions on specific stock holdings

Specifically, and distinct from other investment apps, DayTrader will allow the user to:
- See in one view the performance of different stocks, as well as where and when investments in those stocks were made.
- Show the user select analyst information on those stocks.
- Store observations, actions and notes.
- Log what stocks they have bought / sold, along with the date, quantity and price

Planned enhancements:
- Increase richness of data on each page
- Add authorizations for multi-user access
- Add scraping from other sites as needed
- Improve the graphing visuals - explore other libraries
- Improve the performance
- Further validations
